# Microbial Ecology Group (MEG)
(https://megares.meglab.org/)

Our international multidisciplinary group of scientists and educators is addressing the issues of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and microbial ecology in agriculture through research, outreach, and education. By characterizing risks related to AMR and microbial ecology, our center will identify agricultural production practices that are harmful and can be avoided, while also identifying and promoting production practices and interventions that are beneficial or do no harm to the ecosystem or public health. This will allow society to realize “sustainable intensification” of agriculture.
